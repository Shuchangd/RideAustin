                            <p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/pickup.gif" name="myImage" alt="" /></span>The animated GIF shows the mobility patterns of ride hailing use over 24 hours in Austin. As shown in the animated GIF on our website, most of the trips happen within the center city. This implies that Austin has a strong city center. From 8 am to almost midnight in the evening, it is evident that the ride hailing activities increase outside the city center compared with the travel pattern before 8am and expand to the whole Travis county. However, the ride hailing activities in the surrounding two counties remain at a relatively small amounts during the day and vary across one day. </br> </br>This visualization shows that RideAustin, which is similar to the role of Lyft in Los Angeles, evident in Anne Brownâ€™s paper, facilitates the flexible non-work trips in the suburban areas, which lacks public transportation services. Additionally, it shows that there exists spatial inequality in the ride hailing service in Austin. Most of the services concentrate in the city center, regardless of the time over a day. This almost unvarying pattern of high-intensity use of ride hailing in the center city of Austin also demonstrates that Austin is an energetic and young city. Many millennials and college students living in the city centers and have rich night lives. A further investigation into the destinations of these activities in the city center over a day may show more interesting results.</br> </br></br> </br></br> </br></br> </br></p>
